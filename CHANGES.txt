Changelog
=========

2.13.2 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Preserve the `actual_result_count` on all lazy return values. This allows
  to get proper batching information from catalog results which have been
  restricted by `sort_limit`.

- Made sure `actual_result_count` is available on all lazy classes and falls
  back to `__len__` if not explicitly provided.

- Optimized length calculation of Lazy classes.

2.13.1 (2010-12-25)
-------------------

- Added automatic sorting limit calculation based on batch arguments. If the
  query contains a `b_start` and `b_size` argument and no explicit `sort_limit`
  is provided, the sort limit will be calculated as `b_start + b_size`.

- Avoid pre-allocation of marker items in `LazyMap`.

2.13.0 (2010-12-25)
-------------------

- Fix `LazyMap` to avoid unnecessary function calls.

- Released as separate distribution.
